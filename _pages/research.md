</h3>

    <i> Abstract:</i> Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden (Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2013) have provided
a normative defense of markets from a virtue ethics perspective. They interpret market
exchange as being a practice in the sense of Alasdair MacIntyre. For Bruni and Sugden, the telos
of a market is mutual benefit and a market virtue is a character trait or disposition that contributes
to the realization of this benefit. They regard market virtues as embodying a moral attitude towards
market interactions that is characterized by reciprocity. For MacIntyre, this is a partial account of
a virtue. To qualify as a virtue, it is also necessary that it contributes to the good of an individual’s
life taken as a whole and to the social tradition in which both practices and individuals are embedded.
We adopt MacIntye’s understanding of a virtue and consider the extent to which Bruni and
Sugden’s account of market virtues is compatible with respecting the fundamental human good of
dignity in Kant’s sense of this term.

</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px">
Charles Blackorby, David Donaldson, John A. Weymark<br> 
CORE Discussion Paper No. 8014, April 1980.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size:12px">
    <i> Abstract:</i> Harsanyi has advanced three arguments in defence of utilitarianism.
One defence is based on the separability of the social-welfare function
with respect to individual utilities, the second defence requires social
and individual preferences to satisfy the expected utility hypothesis,
while the third defence considers the choices that would be made if there
were an equal chance of obtaining any position in society. We develop a
framework in which these three defences may be compared, We demonstrate
that with complete welfare information each of these proposals results in
a different ordering of the social alternatives, and that none of these is
classical utilitarianism.
