    <i> Abstract:</i> Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden (Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2013) have provided
a normative defense of markets from a virtue ethics perspective. They interpret market
exchange as being a practice in the sense of Alasdair MacIntyre. For Bruni and Sugden, the telos
of a market is mutual benefit and a market virtue is a character trait or disposition that contributes
to the realization of this benefit. They regard market virtues as embodying a moral attitude towards
market interactions that is characterized by reciprocity. For MacIntyre, this is a partial account of
a virtue. To qualify as a virtue, it is also necessary that it contributes to the good of an individual’s
life taken as a whole and to the social tradition in which both practices and individuals are embedded.
We adopt MacIntye’s understanding of a virtue and consider the extent to which Bruni and
Sugden’s account of market virtues is compatible with respecting the fundamental human good of
dignity in Kant’s sense of this term.
