</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px">

<p style="font-size:12px">
    <i> Abstract:</i> We investigate the strategy-proof provision and financing of indivisible
club good facilities when individuals are subject to congestion costs that are nondecreasing
in the number of other club members and in a private type parameter.
An allocation rule specifies how the individuals are to be partitioned into clubs and
how the costs of the facilities are to be shared by club members as a function of
the types. We show that no allocation rule is strategy-proof and cost efficient (i.e., it
always minimizes the aggregate of the financial and congestion costs of the club facilities)
when congestion costs are strictly increasing in the type parameter, but that
these properties are compatible if congestion costs are dichotomous and costs are
equally shared within a club. We also provide examples of strategy-proof allocation
rules with equal cost sharing that are (i) Pareto optimal and (ii) Pareto optimal, nondictatorial,
and individually rational when the congestion cost is linear in the type
parameter.

to a Public Good Market Demand Problem</a>
</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px">
Paul H. Edelman, Martin Van der Linden, and John A. Weymark<br> 
Current version: November 2020.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size:12px">
    <i> Abstract:</i> The core of a monotonic transferable utility (TU) game is shown to be
the set of prices that incentivize each individual to demand the grand coalition in a
market demand problem in which the goods being demanded are coalitions viewed
as excluable public goods. It is also shown that the core is the intersection of
superdifferentials evaluated at the grand coalition of the covers of person-specific
TU games derived from the original game. These characterizations of the core
demonstrate how a market demand approach to coalition formation in the spirit
of Baldwin and Klemperer is related to the approach to the core using the
cover of a TU game and it superdifferential at the grand coalition developed by
Shapley and Shubik, Aubin, and Danilov and Koshevoy.

</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px">
Luís C. Calderón Gómez, Robert Talisse, John A. Weymark<br> 
Current version: February 2020.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size:12px">
    <i> Abstract:</i> Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden (Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2013) have provided
a normative defense of markets from a virtue ethics perspective. They interpret market
exchange as being a practice in the sense of Alasdair MacIntyre. For Bruni and Sugden, the telos
of a market is mutual benefit and a market virtue is a character trait or disposition that contributes
to the realization of this benefit. They regard market virtues as embodying a moral attitude towards
market interactions that is characterized by reciprocity. For MacIntyre, this is a partial account of
a virtue. To qualify as a virtue, it is also necessary that it contributes to the good of an individual’s
life taken as a whole and to the social tradition in which both practices and individuals are embedded.
We adopt MacIntye’s understanding of a virtue and consider the extent to which Bruni and
Sugden’s account of market virtues is compatible with respecting the fundamental human good of
dignity in Kant’s sense of this term.

</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px">
Charles Blackorby, David Donaldson, John A. Weymark<br> 
CORE Discussion Paper No. 8014, April 1980.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size:12px">
    <i> Abstract:</i> Harsanyi has advanced three arguments in defence of utilitarianism.
One defence is based on the separability of the social-welfare function
with respect to individual utilities, the second defence requires social
and individual preferences to satisfy the expected utility hypothesis,
while the third defence considers the choices that would be made if there
were an equal chance of obtaining any position in society. We develop a
framework in which these three defences may be compared, We demonstrate
that with complete welfare information each of these proposals results in
a different ordering of the social alternatives, and that none of these is
classical utilitarianism.
