No. 80-13, Center for Operations Research and Econometrics, Université catholique  
de Louvain, April 1980.
<br>
<br>
    <i> Abstract:</i> Harsanyi has advanced three arguments in defence of utilitarianism.
One defence is based on the separability of the social-welfare function
with respect to individual utilities, the second defence requires social
and individual preferences to satisfy the expected utility hypothesis,
while the third defence considers the choices that would be made if there
were an equal chance of obtaining any position in society. We develop a
framework in which these three defences may be compared, We demonstrate
that with complete welfare information each of these proposals results in
a different ordering of the social alternatives, and that none of these is
classical utilitarianism.

<br>
<br>
    <i> Abstract:</i> Luigino Bruni and Robert Sugden (Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2013) have provided
a normative defense of markets from a virtue ethics perspective. They interpret market
exchange as being a practice in the sense of Alasdair MacIntyre. For Bruni and Sugden, the telos
of a market is mutual benefit and a market virtue is a character trait or disposition that contributes
to the realization of this benefit. They regard market virtues as embodying a moral attitude towards
market interactions that is characterized by reciprocity. For MacIntyre, this is a partial account of
a virtue. To qualify as a virtue, it is also necessary that it contributes to the good of an individual’s
life taken as a whole and to the social tradition in which both practices and individuals are embedded.
We adopt MacIntye’s understanding of a virtue and consider the extent to which Bruni and
Sugden’s account of market virtues is compatible with respecting the fundamental human good of
dignity in Kant’s sense of this term.

<br>
<br>
<i> Abstract:</i> When a case is before the U.S. Supreme Court, a precedent may apply. In
cases in which a precedent is being considered, the Court needs to answer three questions:
(1) Is the precedent good law? (2) Does the precedent apply to this case? (3) Should
the Court uphold the precedent? In the event that the Court answers yes to the rst two
questions and no to the last, there is what David Cohen (Boston University Law Review,
2010) calls a precedent-based voting paradox. Cohen has identied eleven instances
of this paradox in U.S. Supreme Court decisions prior to 2010. We review Cohen's
paradox and relate it to the doctrinal paradox that has played a foundational role in the
judgment aggregation literature. We also identify what is arguably one more instance of
a precedent-based voting paradox in the period since Cohen's article was published.
