    <i> Abstract:</i> We investigate the strategy-proof provision and financing of indivisible
club good facilities when individuals are subject to congestion costs that are nondecreasing
in the number of other club members and in a private type parameter.
An allocation rule specifies how the individuals are to be partitioned into clubs and
how the costs of the facilities are to be shared by club members as a function of
the types. We show that no allocation rule is strategy-proof and cost efficient (i.e., it
always minimizes the aggregate of the financial and congestion costs of the club facilities)
when congestion costs are strictly increasing in the type parameter, but that
these properties are compatible if congestion costs are dichotomous and costs are
equally shared within a club. We also provide examples of strategy-proof allocation
rules with equal cost sharing that are (i) Pareto optimal and (ii) Pareto optimal, nondictatorial,
and individually rational when the congestion cost is linear in the type
parameter.

to a Public Good Market Demand Problem</a>
</h3>

    <i> Abstract:</i> The core of a monotonic transferable utility (TU) game is shown to be
the set of prices that incentivize each individual to demand the grand coalition in a
market demand problem in which the goods being demanded are coalitions viewed
as excluable public goods. It is also shown that the core is the intersection of
superdifferentials evaluated at the grand coalition of the covers of person-specific
TU games derived from the original game. These characterizations of the core
demonstrate how a market demand approach to coalition formation in the spirit
of Baldwin and Klemperer is related to the approach to the core using the
cover of a TU game and it superdifferential at the grand coalition developed by
Shapley and Shubik, Aubin, and Danilov and Koshevoy.
